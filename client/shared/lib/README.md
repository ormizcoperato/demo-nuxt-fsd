### a collection of internal libraries.

#### This folder should not be treated as helpers or utilities [(read here why these folders often turn into a dump)](https://dev.to/sergeysova/why-utils-helpers-is-a-dump-45fo) . Instead, every library in this folder should have one area of focus, for example, dates, colors, text manipulation, etc. That area of focus should be documented in a README file. The developers in your team should know what can and cannot be added to these libraries.
